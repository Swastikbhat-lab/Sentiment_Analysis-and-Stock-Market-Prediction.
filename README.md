## Project Overview

This project aims to detect sentiments using a neural network. The primary features extracted from the data are relevant for sentiment analysis tasks. The model used is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from the Scikit-learn library.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains textual data labeled with corresponding sentiments. Each text is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: `librosa`, `soundfile`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `google-colab`

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-project.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-project
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Upload Dataset

Ensure your dataset is uploaded to the appropriate directory.

### 2. Extract Features

Run the feature extraction function to extract relevant features from the dataset.

### 3. Train the Model

Train the neural network model using the extracted features.

### 4. Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Stock Market Use Case

### Sentiment Analysis in Stock Market

Sentiment analysis can be applied to the stock market to predict stock trends based on news sentiment. By analyzing news articles, social media posts, and other sources of information, we can gauge the general sentiment towards a particular stock or the market as a whole.

### Supporting Code

Below is an example code snippet for applying sentiment analysis to stock market data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from textblob import TextBlob

# Load stock market news data
news_data = pd.read_csv('stock_news.csv')

# Function to get sentiment
def get_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    return 'positive' if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0 else 'negative'

# Apply sentiment analysis
news_data['Sentiment'] = news_data['News'].apply(get_sentiment)

# Display sentiment analysis results
print(news_data.head())
```

## Results

The results section should summarize the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Model Saving and Loading

To save the trained model:

```python
import pickle

# Save the model to a file
pickle.dump(model, open('model.pkl', 'wb'))
```

To load the trained model:

```python
# Load the model from the file
model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
```
